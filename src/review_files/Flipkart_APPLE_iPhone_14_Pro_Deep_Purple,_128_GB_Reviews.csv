Abhishek  Rajput,5,Brilliant,"Earlier I had plan to go with S23+ but buying a iphone is a personal preference, i hve gone through lots of reviews and i came to the conclusion that as a IT person I/we look for smother and faster performance so iphone is significantly better than android. I would rate s23+ 10/10 and even iphone 14 pro 10/10 as the only difference i could see is the os."
Gautam Aggarwal,5,Brilliant,Fantastic product even though it's just an iterative upgrade to iphone 13 pro. The deep purple looks purple when the light hits the phone a certain way and it's beautiful. Dynamic island is very practical and useful. Hopefully it will get better when 3rd party developers start making use of it.Flipkart's delivery was quick and hassle free. The order was delivered on the launch date and was packed well.

Karthik Kommoju,5,Classy product,iPhone 14 pro is definitely a premium device with exceptional camera and solid build quality with excellent design. The phone definitely weighs more compared to regular 13 and 14. The dynamic island is useful in many cases and some apps are making use of this feature really well with great animations especially swiggy. Loved the in hand feel of the mobile. Compact in size and easy to use with one hand
