Abhishek  Rajput,5,Brilliant,"Earlier I had plan to go with S23+ but buying a iphone is a personal preference, i hve gone through lots of reviews and i came to the conclusion that as a IT person I/we look for smother and faster performance so iphone is significantly better than android. I would rate s23+ 10/10 and even iphone 14 pro 10/10 as the only difference i could see is the os."
Gautam Aggarwal,5,Brilliant,Fantastic product even though it's just an iterative upgrade to iphone 13 pro. The deep purple looks purple when the light hits the phone a certain way and it's beautiful. Dynamic island is very practical and useful. Hopefully it will get better when 3rd party developers start making use of it.Flipkart's delivery was quick and hassle free. The order was delivered on the launch date and was packed well.
